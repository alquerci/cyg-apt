Basic Installation
------------------

   Briefly, the shell commands `make; make install` should
build, and install this package.

   The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd` to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `make package` to compile the package.

  2. Optionally, type `make test` to run any self-tests that come with
     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.

  3. Type `make install` to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
     user, and only the `make install` phase executed with root
     privileges.

  4. Optionally, type `make installtest` to repeat any self-tests, but
     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.
     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a
     regular user, particularly if the prior `make install` required
     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed
     correctly.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean`. To also remove all
     genereted fils type `make mrproper`.

Installation Names
------------------

   By default, `make install` installs the package's commands under
`/usr/bin`, share files under `/usr/share`, etc.
