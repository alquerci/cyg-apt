cyg-apt
=======

A Cygwin command line package manager.

Like `apt-get`, `cyg-apt` allows you to install and remove packages on the Cygwin command line, and provides other package management functions.

This project is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/cyg-apt/ with extensive improvements and lots of bugfixes by [@alquerci](https://github.com/alquerci), [@nylen](https://github.com/nylen), and others.

Requirements
------------

* `cygwin` 1.7+
* `gnupg` 1.4+
* `python` 2.6+, &lt;3.0
* `python-argparse` 1.2+
* `xz` (should be installed with Cygwin by default)


Build requirements
------------------

* `make` 3.59+

From source:

    * `automake` 1.9+


Install instructions
--------------------

From source please run `autoreconf` first to generate all required build scripts:

    $ autoreconf -i

Briefly the following commands should configure, make and install this package:

    $ ./configure && make && make install

Some features can be enable by giving to `configure` the option `--enable-FEATURE[=ARG]`:

  * If you want to install the **bash-completion** script then set the `--enable-bash-completion=DIR` option.
    Where `DIR` may be one of the following directories:

    - `pkg-config --variable=completionsdir bash-completion`
    - `${BASH_COMPLETION_DIR}`
    - `/etc/bash_completion.d`

See the [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) file for more detailed instructions.


Usage
-----

`cyg-apt` is similar to `apt-get`.  You can use it to install and remove packages (and more) from the Cygwin command prompt:

    $ cyg-apt install gdb
    ...
    $ gdb
    (gdb)
    $ cyg-apt remove gdb

Type `cyg-apt --help` or `man cyg-apt` to see all commands and options:
